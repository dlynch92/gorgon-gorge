# Gorgon Gorge

Gorgon Gorge is a text based role playing game where the player takes control of a character and has to fight a series of battle in order to win. There are 5 battles in total, with enemy stats and behaviours dependent on the nature they are assigned on creation, and get progressively harder as the player goes on. Gold is obtained from these monsters which can be used outside of a battle to 

Emoji Match is a small memory game in which players are shown a 4x4 grid and have to flip cards over and remember where specific emojis are - the aim of the game is to uncover pairs of matching emojis and the game is won when all pairs are uncovered. The game is lost when the user presses the resign button. A player's performance is tracked by time spent and the amount of times a pair of cards has been flipped over, and a ranking is assigned based on these scores upon completion.

The project consists of one HTML page that it is split into three seperate "screens" via javascript hiding specific elements. The start screen displays some instructions on the game and allows the user to press a button to begin the game. The second screen is where the game itself is played and features interactable cards and a realtime display of the user's score, as well as a button they can use to end that round of the game early. Finally the end screen presents the user with a ranking based on their score as well as previous scores obtained in their session that are dynamically filled into a table, and a button to go back to the game screen to play again where they can try to beat their previous scores.
